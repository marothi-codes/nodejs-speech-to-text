# Basic Node.js speech-to-text console app

This console application serves to demonstrate the power of the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Speech Service.
The application leverages the Free Tier (F0) as only short audio files were uses to test the trnascription capability,
the results were astonishingly good.

I will also test out the google variant using C# and ultimate create a transcription program that leverages cloud AI technologies batch transcribe high volumes of audio files to test the limits and hopefully come up with a compelling solution that serve's the relevant business case for audio transcription, who knows?
